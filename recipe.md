Sift all dry ingredients into one bowl and lightly mix(dry ingredients are: All-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, baking soda). Then add other ingredients in order - eggs, butter, milk, vanilla extract. Whisk thoroughly until even and consistent, and pour contents into proper cake pan. Bake for 180 degrees celcius in a fan forced oven (otherwise 200 degrees celsius in a conventional) and bake for 35 minutes or until cake comes out clean when a skewer goes through the middle of the cake.
